💡 A Note From Me
I work exclusively with top-tier startups that are scaling fast and building things that matter. I'm not here to fill pipelines — I'm here to make the right introductions. If you're a high-calibre engineer who holds yourself to a high standard and wants to work alongside people who do the same, I'd like to know you. I only reach out when there's a genuine, well-matched opportunity on the table.
